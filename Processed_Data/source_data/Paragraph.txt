Title: Weed Response to “Burndown” Herbicides

## Table 1: Weed Response to “Burndown” Herbicides

### Description
This table gives a general comparative rating of “burndown” herbicides used in no-till corn and/or soybean production. 

### Performance Notes
- Under unfavorable conditions, some herbicides may not perform as well as indicated below.
- Under very favorable conditions, control may be better than indicated.
- Herbicide rate, weed size and stage of growth, and environmental conditions interact to influence herbicide performance.

### Weed Control Rating
- 9 = 90% to 100%
- 8 = 80% to 90%
- 7 = 70% to 80%
- 6 = 60% to 70% control
- - = less than 60% control, not recommended.

### Application Notes
- Ratings are for control of existing vegetation only (not residual control).
- Treatments containing glyphosate should be applied with AMS (and surfactant if required by the glyphosate product label).
- Most other treatments should be applied with a COC or MSO (plus UAN if recommended by the label).
- Ratings for 2,4-D are based on a rate of 0.5 lb. ae/A unless otherwise indicated.
- Increasing the 2,4-D rate to 1.0 lb. ae/A will improve control of legumes, dandelion, marestail, and some other weeds.
